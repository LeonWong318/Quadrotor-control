This repo is something related to Quadrotor control realized by FreeRTOS(OS) and Crazyflies(hardware)

In 'project4' folder there are two sub-projects to help you better understand the mutex and scheduling, For more details you can find the README.md in that folder.

In 'project5' folder there is a simulation program to help you evaluate your C-code to control the quadrotor. For more details you can find the README.md in that folder.

In 'Final_Project' folder you can find the simulation files in 'generate_code' which is designed on Simulink and generate C-code which could implemented on a real quadrotor, and in 'write_code' folder you can find the original C-code using FreeRTOS.
