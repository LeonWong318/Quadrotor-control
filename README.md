This repo is something related to Quadrotor control realized by FreeRTOS(OS) and Crazyflies(hardware)

In project 4 folder there are two sub-project to help you better understand the mutex and scheduling, more details you can find the README.md in that folder.

In project 5 folder there is a simulation program help you to evaluate your C-code to control the quadrotor. More details you can find the README.md in that folder.

In Final Project folder you can find the simulation files in generate_code which is designed on Simulink and generate C-code which could implemented on real quadrotor, and in write_code folder you can find the original C-code using FreeRTOS.
